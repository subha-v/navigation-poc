# Adding New Files to Xcode Project

## Important: Manual Xcode Setup Required

The following new files have been created but need to be manually added to the Xcode project:

### Files to Add:
1. `Sources/Utilities/MathUtilities.swift`
2. `Sources/Views/Components/ArrowIndicatorView.swift`  
3. `Sources/Views/Components/DirectionDetailView.swift`

### Steps to Add Files:

1. **Open the Project**
   - Open `VNXNavigationApp.xcodeproj` in Xcode

2. **Add Utilities Group** (if not exists)
   - Right-click on `Sources` folder in project navigator
   - Select "New Group"
   - Name it "Utilities"

3. **Add MathUtilities.swift**
   - Right-click on the `Utilities` group
   - Select "Add Files to VNXNavigationApp..."
   - Navigate to `Sources/Utilities/`
   - Select `MathUtilities.swift`
   - Ensure "Copy items if needed" is UNCHECKED
   - Ensure "VNXNavigationApp" target is CHECKED
   - Click "Add"

4. **Add Component Files**
   - Right-click on `Views/Components` group
   - Select "Add Files to VNXNavigationApp..."
   - Navigate to `Sources/Views/Components/`
   - Select both:
     - `ArrowIndicatorView.swift`
     - `DirectionDetailView.swift`
   - Ensure "Copy items if needed" is UNCHECKED
   - Ensure "VNXNavigationApp" target is CHECKED
   - Click "Add"

5. **Build and Run**
   - Press Cmd+B to build
   - The project should now build successfully

## Alternative: Temporary Fix

If you need to build immediately without adding files to Xcode, the necessary types and extensions have been duplicated inline in the files that need them. However, this is not recommended for production use.

## Verification

After adding the files, verify they appear in:
- Project navigator under the correct groups
- Build Phases â†’ Compile Sources list

The build should succeed without any "Cannot find type" errors.
