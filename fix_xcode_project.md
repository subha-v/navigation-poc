# Fix Xcode Project Build Issues

## The Problem
The Xcode project file is looking for source files in the wrong location.

## Quick Solution

### Option 1: Use Swift Package Mode (Easiest)
1. Close the current Xcode window
2. Open Terminal and run:
```bash
cd "/Users/subha/Downloads/VALUENEX/Navigation PoC/NavigationPoC"
open Package.swift
```
3. This opens in Swift Package mode where all files are automatically found
4. Build and run from there

### Option 2: Fix Current Project
1. In Xcode with the .xcodeproj open:
2. Select the red `NavigationPoCApp.swift` file
3. In the right sidebar (File Inspector), click the folder icon next to "Location"
4. Navigate to: `/Users/subha/Downloads/VALUENEX/Navigation PoC/NavigationPoC/Sources/NavigationPoC/App/`
5. Select `NavigationPoCApp.swift`
6. Click "Choose"

### Option 3: Create New App Target
1. File → New → Target
2. Choose iOS → App
3. Name it "NavigationPoCApp"
4. This creates a proper app structure

## If you still get errors:
The issue is that the basic .xcodeproj file I created earlier doesn't have all the source files properly linked. You need to either:
- Use the Swift Package directly (Option 1 - recommended)
- Or create a proper iOS app project that references the Swift Package as a dependency
